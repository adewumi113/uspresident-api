        'party': 'Independent',
        'birthLocation': 'Westmoreland County, Virginia',
        'dob': 'February 22, 1732',
        'died': 'December 14, 1799',

        'inOffice': 'April 30, 1789 - March 4, 1797',
        'vicePresident' :	'John Adams',
        'about': 'George Washington was an American Founding Father, military officer, politician and statesman who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in 1775, he led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the U.S. federal government. Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As the first U.S. president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while additionally sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title "Mr. President", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. Washington has thus been known as the \'Father of the Nation\'. Washington\'s image is an icon of American culture. He has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency. In 1976, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of general of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army. He consistently ranks in both popular and scholarly polls as one of the greatest presidents in American history.'

        'about': 'John Adams was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain. During the latter part of the Revolutionary War and in the early years of the new nation, he served the U.S. government as a senior diplomat in Europe. Adams was the first person to hold the office of vice president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams and his friend and political rival Thomas Jefferson. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a leader of the revolution. He assisted Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its primary advocate in Congress. As a diplomat he helped negotiate a peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States Constitution, as did his essay Thoughts on Government.'

He was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming president in 1801, he was the nation\'s first U.S. secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation\'s second vice president under John Adams. As president, Jefferson assertively defended the nation\'s shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Beginning in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation\'s geographic size. In his second presidential term, Jefferson was beset by difficulties at home, including the trial of his former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act to defend the nation\'s industries from British threats to U.S. shipping, limiting foreign trade and stimulating the birth of the American manufacturing industry.'

        'about': 'James Madison Jr. was an American statesman, diplomat, and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States. He was popularly acclaimed the "Father of the Constitution" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights. During the early 1790s, he opposed the economic program and the accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Alongside Thomas Jefferson, he organized the Democraticâ€“Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton\'s Federalist Party. After Jefferson was elected president in 1800, Madison served as his Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809 and supported Jefferson in the case of Marbury v. Madison. Motivated by desire to acquire land held by Britain, Spain, and Native Americans, and after diplomatic protests with a trade embargo failed to end British seizures of American shipped goods, Madison led the United States into the War of 1812. Although the war ended inconclusively, many Americans viewed the war\'s outcome as a successful "second war of independence" against Britain.'

Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and later, in the mid-1830s, became affiliated with the Whig Party. Multilingual, Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison\'s presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Adams as his secretary of state. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.'

        'about': 'Andrew Jackson Jr was an American lawyer, planter, general, and statesman who served as the seventh president of the United States. Before his presidency, he gained fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Often praised as an advocate for ordinary Americans and for his work in preserving the union of states, Jackson has also been criticized for his racial policies, particularly his treatment of Native Americans. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson\'s victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 made him a national hero. He later commanded U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the annexation of Florida from Spain. He briefly served as Florida\'s first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in 1824. He won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote, but no candidate won the electoral majority. With the help of Henry Clay, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams in a contingent election. Jackson\'s supporters alleged that there was a "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Clay and began creating their own political organization that would eventually become the Democratic Party.'

Van Buren won the presidency in 1836 against divided Whig opponents, the first president of non-Anglo-Saxon heritage. He lost re-election in 1840, and failed to win the Democratic nomination in 1844. Later in his life, he emerged as an elder statesman and an important anti-slavery leader who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848 presidential election. Most residents in Kinderhook, New York were of Dutch descent and spoke Dutch as their primary language; he is the only president to have spoken English as a second language. As the leader of the Bucktails faction, he emerged as the most influential politician from New York in the 1820s and established a political machine known as the Albany Regency.'

        'about': 'William Henry Harrison was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States. He died just 31 days after his inauguration as president in 1841, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history. He was also the first U.S. president to die in office, causing a brief constitutional crisis since presidential succession was not then fully defined in the United States Constitution. He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies and was the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United States. Harrison was born into the Harrison family of Virginia at their homestead, Berkeley Plantation. He was a son of Benjamin Harrison V, a Founding Father of the United States. During his early military career, he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers, an American military victory that ended the Northwest Indian War. Later, he led a military force against Tecumseh\'s confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, where he earned the nickname "Old Tippecanoe". He was promoted to major general in the Army during the War of 1812, and led American infantry and cavalry to victory at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada.'

        'about': 'John Tyler was an American politician who served as the tenth president of the United States from 1841 to 1845, after briefly holding office as the tenth vice president in 1841. He was elected vice president on the 1840 Whig ticket with President William Henry Harrison, succeeding to the presidency following Harrison\'s death 31 days after assuming office. Tyler was a stalwart supporter and advocate of states\' rights, including regarding slavery, and he adopted nationalistic policies as president only when they did not infringe on the states\' powers. His unexpected rise to the presidency posed a threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other Whig politicians and left Tyler estranged from both of the nation\'s major political parties at the time. Tyler became the first vice president to succeed to the presidency. Amid uncertainty as to whether a vice president succeeded a deceased president, or merely took on his duties, Tyler immediately took the presidential oath of office, setting a lasting precedent. He signed into law some of the Whig-controlled Congress\'s bills, but he was a strict constructionist and vetoed the party\'s bills to create a national bank and raise tariff rates. He believed that the president, rather than Congress, should set policy, and he sought to bypass the Whig establishment led by Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler\'s cabinet resigned shortly into his term and the Whigs expelled him from the party, dubbing him "His Accidency". Tyler was the first president to have his veto of legislation overridden by Congress.'

A protÃ©gÃ© of Andrew Jackson, he was a member of the Democratic Party and an advocate of Jacksonian democracy. He was known for extending the territory of the United States through the Mexicanâ€“American War during his presidency, annexing the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession after winning the Mexicanâ€“American War. Though he is relatively obscure today, scholars have ranked Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda. He has also been criticized for leading the country into a war with Mexico that exacerbated sectional divides. A property owner who used slave labor, he kept a plantation in Mississippi and increased his slave ownership during his presidency. His policy of territorial expansion saw the nation reach the Pacific coast and almost all its contiguous borders. He made the U.S. a nation poised to become a world power, but with divisions between free and slave states gravely exacerbated, setting the stage for the Civil War.'

He was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general and becoming a national hero for his victories in the Mexicanâ€“American War. As a result, he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was to preserve the Union. He died 16 months into his term from a stomach disease. In 1845, during the annexation of Texas, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande in anticipation of a battle with Mexico over the disputed Texasâ€“Mexico border. The Mexicanâ€“American War broke out in April 1846, and Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, driving Arista\'s troops out of Texas. Taylor then led his troops into Mexico, where they defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey. Defying orders, Taylor led his troops further south and, despite being severely outnumbered, dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista. Taylor\'s troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor retained his popularity.'

        'about': 'Millard Fillmore was an American statesman who served as the thirteenth president of the United States from 1850 to 1853. Fillmore became president following the death of Zachary Taylor. As the Whig Party broke up after his presidency, he and many in its conservative wing joined the Know Nothings and formed the American Party. Despite his party\'s emphasis on anti-immigration and anti-Catholic policies, during his 1856 candidacy, he said little about immigration, focusing on the preservation of the Union, and won only Maryland. During the American Civil War, he denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was critical of Abraham Lincoln\'s war policies. After peace was restored, he supported President Andrew Johnson\'s Reconstruction policies. He remained involved in civic interests in retirement, including as chancellor of the University of Buffalo, which he had helped found in 1846. Historians consistently rank him among the worst presidents in American history, largely for his policies regarding slavery, as well as among the least memorable. His association with the Know Nothings and support of Johnson\'s reconstruction policies further tarnished his reputation and legacy. As president, he faced the divisive issue of slavery, particularly with the passage of the Compromise of 1850. He supported compromise measures, including the Fugitive Slave Act, to maintain the fragile balance between free and slave states. His presidency was also associated with the opening of relations with Japan through the Perry Expedition.'

Conflict between North and South continued after his presidency, and, after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, the Southern states seceded, resulting in the American Civil War. He faced challenges during his presidency, including the contentious issue of whether territories acquired in the Mexican-American War would allow slavery. His support for the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed territories to decide the issue of slavery through popular sovereignty, led to increased sectional tensions and violence, notably in "Bleeding Kansas." His presidency was also marked by his commitment to territorial expansion and strengthening diplomatic ties with other nations.'

His presidency is often criticized for its perceived failure to address the deepening divide between North and South, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Civil War. He supported the ineffective Corwin Amendment in an effort to reconcile the country. He made an unsuccessful attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter, but otherwise refrained from preparing the military. In his personal life, he never married and was the only U.S. president to remain a lifelong bachelor, leading some historians and authors to question his sexual orientation. His failure to forestall the Civil War has been described as incompetence, and he spent his last years defending his reputation.

        'about': 'Abraham Lincoln was an American statesman and politician who served as the sixteenth president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. He led the nation through the Civil War, preserving the Union, ending slavery, strengthening the federal government, and modernizing the U.S economy. His leadership and eloquent speeches, including the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation, have made him one of the most revered figures in American history. His presidency is marked by his commitment to national unity and the principles of democracy. He managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states "in rebellion" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to "recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons", and to receive them "into the armed service of the United States." He pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford\'s Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary, when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. He is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. He is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.'

        'about': 'Andrew Johnson was an American statesman who served as the seventeenth president of the United States from 1865 to 1869. He became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. As president, he faced the challenges of Reconstruction following the Civil War. His approach to Reconstruction was lenient towards the Southern states, leading to conflict with the Radical Republicans in Congress. His presidency is marked by his impeachment by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote. He implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction, a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform their civil governments. Southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, but Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. He vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency.He opposed the Fourteenth Amendment which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, he went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to break Republican opposition. His strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for black Americans is widely criticized. Historians have consistently ranked him one of the worst presidents in American history.'

Under him, the Union was completely restored. He appointed African Americans and Jewish Americans to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission, advancing the civil service more than any prior president. In 2022, he became the third person in U.S. history to be promoted to General of the Armies in celebration of the bicentennial of his birth. At the time of his death, he was the most popular American and was memorialized as a symbol of national unity. '

        'about': 'Rutherford B. Hayes was an American statesman who served as the nineteenth president of the United States from 1877 to 1881. He became president in a controversial election, where the Compromise of 1877 led to his selection as part of a political agreement. As president, he focused on civil service reform, attempting to reduce corruption in government appointments. He also pursued policies to reconcile the North and South after the Civil War, emphasizing economic development and education. His administration was influenced by his belief in meritocratic government and equal treatment without regard to wealth, social standing, or race. One of the defining events of his presidency was the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, which he resolved by calling in the US Army against the railroad workers. It remains the deadliest conflict between workers and strikebreakers in American history. As president, he implemented modest civil-service reforms that laid the groundwork for further reform in the 1880s and 1890s. He vetoed the Blandâ€“Allison Act of 1878, which put silver money into circulation and raised nominal prices; he saw the maintenance of the gold standard as essential to economic recovery. His policy toward western Indians anticipated the assimilationist program of the Dawes Act of 1887. At the end of his term, Hayes kept his pledge not to run for reelection and retired to his home in Ohio. He became an advocate of social and educational reform.'

Garfield\'s presidency was cut short by his assassination, making his tenure one of the shortest in U.S. history.  A lawyer and Civil War general, he served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives and is the only sitting member of the House to be elected president. Before his candidacy for the presidency, he had been elected to the U.S. Senate by the Ohio General Assemblyâ€”a position he declined when he became president-elect. Before his presidency, he had a distinguished career as a Union general during the Civil War and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. His presidency focused on civil service reform and economic issues, but he did not have the opportunity to fully implement his agenda. His accomplishments as president included his assertion of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, a purge of corruption in the Post Office, and his appointment of a Supreme Court justice. He advocated for agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reforms, which were passed by Congress in 1883 as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur.'

As president, he presided over the rebirth of the U.S. Navy, but he was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus which had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War. He vetoed the first version of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, arguing that its twenty-year ban on Chinese immigrants to the United States violated the Burlingame Treaty, but he signed a second version, which included a ten-year ban. He appointed Horace Gray and Samuel Blatchford to the Supreme Court. He also enforced the Immigration Act of 1882 to impose more restrictions on immigrants and the Tariff of 1883 to attempt to reduce tariffs. He signed into law the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which came as a surprise to reformers who held a negative reputation of Arthur as a Stalwart and product of Conkling\'s organization.'

Before his presidency, he had a career as a lawyer and he served as a mayor and governor of New York state, winning fame as an anti-corruption crusader. He was the first Democrat to win the presidency after the Civil War, and was one of two Democrat presidents, followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912, in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 and 1933. His presidencies are marked by his commitment to fiscal responsibility, civil service reform, and opposition to protective tariffs. As his second administration began, the Panic of 1893 sparked a severe national depression. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that started the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era. An anti-imperialist, he opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against the Hawaiian queen, and called for her to be restored; the House of Representatives adopted a resolution against annexation. He was a formidable policymaker, but also garnered criticism.'

During his administration, six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, he substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans were unsuccessful. Due in large part to surplus revenues from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. In 1899 he represented Venezuela in its British Guiana boundary dispute with Great Britain. Many have praised Harrison\'s commitment to African Americans\' voting rights, and his work ethic and integrity, but scholars and historians generally rank him as an average President, due to the uneventful nature of his term.'

He led a realignment that made Republicans largely dominant in the industrial states and nationwide for decades. He presided over victory in the Spanishâ€“American War of 1898; gained control of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba; restored prosperity after a deep depression; rejected the inflationary monetary policy of free silver, keeping the nation on the gold standard; and raised protective tariffs. His presidency saw the passage of the Gold Standard Act and the establishment of the Gold Standard, linking the value of the U.S. dollar to a specific quantity of gold. His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial and, together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office, led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890. He was elected governor of Ohio in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests. He secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896 amid a deep economic depression and defeated his Democratic rival William Jennings Bryan after a front porch campaign in which he advocated "sound money" (the gold standard unless altered by international agreement) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity.'

In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He expanded the Navy and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project American naval power. His successful efforts to broker the end of the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize, making him the first American to ever win a Nobel Prize. He was elected to a full term in 1904 and promoted policies more to the left, despite growing opposition from Republican leaders.

As president, he focused on trust-busting, tariff reform, and conservation policies. Taft faced challenges within his party, leading to a split in the Republican Party during the 1912 election. In the White House, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party\'s conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Theodore Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and he bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in Woodrow Wilson\'s victory.'

During his first year as president, he authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy.

He chose not to seek re-election in 1928 remarking that ten years as president would be "longer than any other man has had it â€“ too long! Throughout his gubernatorial career, Coolidge ran on the record of fiscal conservatism, strong support for women\'s suffrage, and a vague opposition to Prohibition. During his presidency, he restored public confidence in the White House after the many scandals of the Harding administration. He signed into law the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans, and oversaw a period of rapid and expansive economic growth known as the "Roaring Twenties", leaving office with considerable popularity. He was known for his hands-off governing approach and pro-business stances; as biographer Claude Fuess wrote: "He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength. He gains nearly universal praise for his stalwart support of racial equality during a period of heightened racial tension in the United States'

        'about': 'Herbert Hoover was an American engineer, businessman, and politician who served as the thirty-first president of the United States from 1929 to 1933. He took office just before the onset of the Great Depression. His presidency faced the challenges of economic downturn and widespread unemployment. Hoover\'s administration implemented various measures to address the economic crisis, but his efforts were largely criticized. He served as the secretary of commerce under presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. He was an unusually active and visible Cabinet member, becoming known as "Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments." He was influential in the development of air travel and radio. He led the federal response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. During his first year in office, the stock market crashed, signaling the onset of the Great Depression, which dominated his presidency. His response to the depression was widely seen as lackluster and he scapegoated Mexican Americans for the economic crisis. Approximately 1.5-2 million Mexican Americans were forcibly "repatriated" to Mexico in a forced migration campaign known as the Mexican Repatriation â€” a majority of them were born in the United States.'

        'about': 'Franklin D. Roosevelt was an American statesman and politician who served as the thirty-second president of the United States. He led the nation through the Great Depression and World War II, implementing the New Deal, a series of programs and policies aimed at economic recovery. He was the only president to be elected to four terms, serving from 1933 to 1945. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, he won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. He was unable to expand the Supreme Court in 1937, the same year the conservative coalition was formed to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under him include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Social Security. With World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, he gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, while the U.S. remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he obtained a declaration of war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. His leadership during challenging times has had a lasting impact on American politics.'

        'about': 'Harry S. Truman was an American statesman who served as the thirty-third president of the United States. He assumed the presidency following the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. His presidency saw the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War. Truman made the decision to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan\'s surrender. He also implemented the Marshall Plan to aid European post-war recovery and played a key role in the founding of the United Nations. His administration engaged in an internationalist foreign policy by working closely with Britain. He staunchly denounced isolationism. He energized the New Deal coalition during the 1948 presidential election, despite a divided Democratic Party, and won a surprise victory against Republican Party nominee Thomas E. Dewey that secured his own presidential term. Truman presided over the onset of the Cold War in 1947. He oversaw the Berlin Airlift and Marshall Plan in 1948. With the involvement of the US in the Korean War of 1950â€“1953, South Korea repelled the invasion by North Korea. Domestically, the postwar economic challenges such as strikes and inflation created a mixed reaction over the effectiveness of his administration. In 1948, he proposed Congress pass comprehensive civil rights legislation. Congress refused, so Truman issued Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981, which prohibited discrimination in federal agencies and desegregated the U.S. Armed Forces.'

        'about': 'Dwight D. Eisenhower, often referred to as "Ike," was an American military officer and statesman who served as the thirty-fourth president of the United States. He was a five-star general during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe. He planned and supervised two of the most consequential military campaigns of World War II: Operation Torch in the North Africa campaign in 1942â€“1943 and the invasion of Normandy in 1944. As president, he focused on Cold War policies, including the doctrine of "massive retaliation" and the promotion of nuclear arms reduction. He also implemented the Interstate Highway System. After the United States entered World War II, he oversaw the invasions of North Africa and Sicily before supervising the invasions of France and Germany. After the war ended in Europe, he served as military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany (1945), Army Chief of Staff (1945â€“1948), president of Columbia University (1948â€“1953), and as the first supreme commander of NATO (1951â€“1952). He continued Harry S. Truman\'s policy of recognizing Taiwan as the legitimate government of China, and he won congressional approval of the Formosa Resolution. His administration provided major aid to help the French fight off Vietnamese Communists in the First Indochina War. In 1957, following the Soviet launch of Sputnik, he led the American response which included the creation of NASA and the establishment of a stronger, science-based education via the National Defense Education Act. The Soviet Union began to reinforce their own space program, escalating the Space Race. His two terms saw unprecedented economic prosperity except for a minor recession in 1958.'

Kennedy, often known as JFK, was an American statesman and politician who served as the thirty-fifth president of the United States from January 20, 1961, until his assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963. He was the youngest person elected president. He was known for his charismatic presence and youthful energy. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940, joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded PT boats in the Pacific theater. His survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. His presidency faced challenges such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the early years of the civil rights movement. His presidency saw high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam, and the Strategic Hamlet Program began during his presidency. In 1961, he authorized attempts to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion and Operation Mongoose. In October 1962, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in nuclear war. In August 1961, after East German troops erected the Berlin Wall, he sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and delivered one of his most famous speeches in West Berlin in June 1963. In 1963, he signed the first nuclear weapons treaty. He presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon before 1970. He supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.'

The following year, he was elected to the presidency in a landslide, winning the largest share of the popular vote for the Democratic Party in history, and the highest for any candidate since the advent of widespread popular elections in the 1820s. His presidency is known for the passage of landmark civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also escalated U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, facing criticism and protests. His Great Society was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to health care, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. He sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading the war on poverty. As part of these efforts, he signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. He made the Apollo program a national priority; enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965, which established federally insured student loans; and signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white Southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and Black voters who sporadically supported the Democrats prior to 1964 began shifting towards the party in historic numbers. Due to his domestic agenda, his presidency marked the peak of modern American liberalism in the 20th century.'

He implemented the ratified Twenty-sixth Amendment, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, and enforced the desegregation of Southern schools. Under him, relations with Native Americans improved, seeing an increase in self-determination for Native Americans and his administration rescinded the termination policy. Nixon imposed wage and price controls for 90 days, began the war on cancer, and presided over the Apollo 11 Moon landing, which signaled the end of the Space Race.

Ford is the only person to become U.S. president without winning an election for president or vice president. His presidency focused on stabilizing the nation after the Watergate scandal and addressing economic challenges. He is known for granting a pardon to Nixon for any crimes he may have committed while in office, a decision that was widely debated. He also faced challenges such as inflation and the fall of Saigon, marking the end of the Vietnam War. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession. Foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the president. He signed the Helsinki Accords, which marked a move toward dÃ©tente in the Cold War. With the collapse of South Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War essentially ended. In the 1976 Republican presidential primary, Ford defeated Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination, but narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter.'

        'about': 'Ronald Reagan was an American actor and politician who served as the fortieth president of the United States. He had a successful career in Hollywood before entering politics. His presidency constituted the Reagan era, and he is considered one of the most prominent conservative figures in American history. His administration faced challenges such as the Cold War, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), and the Iran-Contra affair. In his first term, he implemented "Reaganomics", which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation. He escalated an arms race and transitioned Cold War policy away from dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union. Reagan also ordered the invasion of Grenada in 1983. Additionally, he survived an assassination attempt, fought public-sector labor unions, expanded the war on drugs, and was slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic in the United States, which began early in his presidency. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the Iranâ€“Iraq War, the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras, and a more conciliatory approach in talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that culminated in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the unemployment rate having fallen, and the United States having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. His policies also helped contribute to the end of the Cold War and the end of Soviet communism.'

He signed into law welfare reform and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but he was still comfortably re-elected president in 1996 against both the Republican Party nominee Bob Dole and the Reform Party nominee Perot. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of his presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplusâ€”the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. His foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeliâ€“Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. His policies reflected a centrist "Third Way" political philosophy, became known as a New Democrat. His presidency also faced controversies, including the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives, though he was acquitted by the Senate.

He was the first African American president of the United States. Nine months after his inauguration, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. Obama\'s first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis, and included a major stimulus package, to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession, a partial extension of George W. Bush\'s tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major U.S. military presence in Iraq. He also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. His presidency is known for the Affordable Care Act, the killing of Osama bin Laden, and the signing of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He also focused on issues such as climate change, immigration reform, and improved relations with Cuba. He also ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.  In his second term, he took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. He negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during his second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout his presidency. He promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, and during his presidency the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.'

As president, he ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for migrants detained at the U.S. border. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. He initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 3 times but made no progress on denuclearization. His administration made efforts to broker peace agreements in the Middle East.
